Now that GNU gcc/g++ have been installed you need to know how to actually compile.

STEP 1.
First you must check that your Frameworks are in the appropriate foldeNow . (as this repo is about macs it will use Unix commands):

        $ ls /Library/Frameworks

        iTuneFramwork.framework         mono.framework
        AssetsLibrary.framework         XamarinIOS.framwork
        SDL2.framework

(Using this command should return something similar, however the important thing is the framework you are using, in this case SDL2)

STEP 2.
Now change your directory to where the file/ folder to compile is:

    $ cd Where/Your/File/Is

optionally you can now list to make sure you have the file.

    $ ls
    theFile.cpp

STEP 3.
now you must actually compile it (the executable will be stored in same directory):

    $ g++ theFile.cpp -o executable.o -framework SDL2 -F /Library/Frameworks

Lets break it down:

first, we use "g++" to tell the system that we are using the g++ compiler (you can type gcc instead).
next, we specify the file to compile "theFile.cpp"
thirdly, we type "-o" to name our executable, we can then name our executable anything but preferably add ".o" to the end.
next, use "-framework" and then list the framework name "SDL2"
lastly, to tell the compiler where the .framework file is use the path command "-F" (must be capital) and the folder it is in, "/Library/Frameworks"

STEP 4.
to call the executable make sure you are still in the right directory:

optionally you can check if it is there:

    $ ls
    theFile.cpp     executable.o

now use "./" to call an executable:

    $ ./executable.o

DONE 2.
This will now work as an app or can be called from terminal.
