Most computers will have the GNU gcc/g++ compiler for c/c++.

STEP 1.
If you know that you have gcc/g++ you can skip this file, if you are not sure  type this command into terminal:

        $ gcc --version
                OR
        $ g++ --version

STEP 2.
If you do not have gcc/g++ and get a pop-up error along the lines of:
        
        "gcc" or "g++ command requires the command line developer tools. Would you like to install them now?"

STEP 3.
Now accept the prompt to install command line developer tools (Xcode)

DONE 1.
You now have the compiler installed. Continue to the next txt file.
